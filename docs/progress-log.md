## Initial Setup - 2024-01-01

**What was done:**
- Created project structure with Docker Compose
- Set up Next.js 14 frontend with TypeScript
- Set up FastAPI backend with Python 3.11
- Configured PostgreSQL database
- Created initial database migrations
- Implemented health check and debug endpoints
- Created dashboard UI with sidebar navigation
- Integrated frontend with backend API
- Added comprehensive documentation

**Decisions made:**
- **Next.js 14 App Router**: Modern approach, better performance than Pages Router
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Catch bugs early, better IDE support
- **FastAPI over Django/Flask**: Async support, automatic docs, modern Python
- **PostgreSQL over MySQL**: Better JSON support, robust for future features
- **Docker Compose**: Simplifies development, consistent environments
- **shadcn/ui**: Accessible components, easy customization with Tailwind
- **Alembic**: Industry standard for SQLAlchemy migrations
- **SSE for MCP**: Better than WebSockets for server-to-client streaming
- **Stub implementations**: Get infrastructure working first, implement features later

**Challenges:**
- None yet - initial setup

**Next steps:**
- Test the application end-to-end
- Implement authentication (JWT)
- Connect to actual LLM providers (Anthropic/OpenAI)
- Implement MCP tools with real API integrations
- Build report generation UI and logic
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Tips for Logging

- **Be specific**: Include code snippets, commands, or configuration changes
- **Document why**: Explain the reasoning behind decisions
- **Note challenges**: Future you will thank present you
- **Track time**: How long did tasks take? Helps with estimation
- **Link resources**: URLs to docs, Stack Overflow posts, etc.
- **Update regularly**: Log after each significant change, not just at the end

## Example Entry

### 2024-01-15 - JWT Authentication Implementation

**What was done:**
- Added `python-jose` and `passlib` to requirements.txt
- Created `app/auth.py` with token generation and validation functions
- Implemented password hashing with bcrypt
- Added `POST /api/auth/register` and `POST /api/auth/login` endpoints
- Created `get_current_user` dependency for protected routes
- Updated User model with `hashed_password` field
- Generated Alembic migration for password field

**Decisions made:**
- **JWT over sessions**: Stateless, better for scaling
- **bcrypt for passwords**: Industry standard, secure
- **15-minute access tokens**: Balance between security and UX
- **7-day refresh tokens**: Allow staying logged in
- **HS256 algorithm**: Simpler than RS256 for our use case

**Challenges:**
- Decided to store refresh tokens in database to enable revocation
- Had to handle timezone-aware datetimes for token expiry
- Frontend localStorage security concerns - documented in code comments

**Next steps:**
- Add refresh token endpoint
- Implement token revocation on logout
- Add frontend auth context and hooks
- Protected route components
- Remember me functionality

**Code snippets:**
```python
# app/auth.py
def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt
```
